# passPwnedCheck.py utilizes the API from haveibeenpwned.com; which contains over 1/2 billion passwords
# These passwords have been exposed in previous breaches and stored in SHA-1 hash
# Details of the site/API can be found under https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords
#
# pasPwnedCheck.py does not expose the password or its hash to haveibeenpwned.com
# As they implement a k-Anonymity model; which allows querying by partial hash only
